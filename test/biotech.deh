YOU HAVE ENTERED DEEPLY INTO THE INFESTED
STARPORT. BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE
MONSTERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OWN REALITY
WITH THEM, AND THE STARPORT'S TECHNOLOGY
IS BEING SUBVERTED BY THEIR PRESENCE.

AHEAD, YOU SEE AN OUTPOST OF HELL, A
FORTIFIED ZONE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST IT,
YOU CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HAUNTED HEART
OF THE STARBASE AND FIND THE CONTROLLING
SWITCH WHICH HOLDS EARTH'S POPULATION
HOSTAGE.That last robot was a lot more trouble
than it looked, and you're starting to
have serious doubts about going on.

Ahead of you, you see something that
looks very familiar, you can't put your
finger on it. Deciding that there is
still a chance that you will live, you
move onward, hoping for the best.

You can feel it, if you survive this
next area, you're free, the money is
yours and you're set for life!
